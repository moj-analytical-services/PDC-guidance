# Introduction

This document provides a checklist for converting statistical release spreadsheets into an accessible format.

The GSS have created detailed [guidance](#links) for creating accessible spreadsheets.

This document aims to summarise the guidance into a simple check list. 

# Why we need to produce accessible spreadsheets

The GSS Best Practice and Impact Division team have [outlined three reasons](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/accessibility-legislation-what-you-need-to-know/) why accessibility is important and why we need to follow it.

1.	[The Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/value/v2-accessibility/) states:

> “The needs of different types of users and potential users should be considered when determining ways of presenting and releasing the statistics and data”

> “The needs of people with disabilities must be considered. Statistics and data should be released using accessible communication formats and means which should work with the most commonly-used assistive technologies”

2.	the UK legislation [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/introduction/made) states: “public sector bodies must comply with the accessibility requirement”, where ‘accessibility requirement’ means the requirement to make a website or mobile application accessible by making it perceivable, operable, understandable and robust – this aligns with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) at the AA standard.

3.	[The Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) (or the [Disability Discrimination Act 1995](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents) in Northern Ireland) states that all UK service providers must consider ‘reasonable adjustments’ for disabled people.

# What does this guidance cover?

This guidance covers how to make MOJ statistical release spreadsheets accessible.  

Two options have been outlined below for creating accessible spreadsheets:

1. Create an unformatted raw data output

2. Reformat existing statistical release tables
 
##  Create an unformatted raw data table

This option involves creating an unformatted raw data output.  By this we mean rows of data with column headings. Once created, there are minor changes required to make the spreadsheet accessible.  

**Reasons for choosing this option:**

- If your data tables are already produced via tools such as R or Python, this option may involve less work than reformatting existing statistical release tables (option 2) as it largely involves exporting a dataset to an external file.

- As part of the GSS Open Data strategy and the Data and Analysis Dissemination Strategy, we are also likely to be moving towards releasing more data as unformatted data tables in future, and so this method will transfer more easily to that model.

### How to produce unformatted raw data table

1.	The starting point for this option is to output the data that makes the final table unformatted. This will usually involve saving an R data frame or SAS data set directly to Excel or as a CSV which is then copied into Excel. 

2.	Ensure cell A1 is formatted as the heading for the sheet.  This is because screen readers start from cell A1.  To do this choose the ‘heading 1’ option from the style section.
Home > Cell style > Heading 1

The heading will automatically format to a standard Excel format.  Following this, remove the border, re-format the font and convert the colour of the text to the automatic colour.  GSS recommends using the automatic colour, as opposed to black, as some users have specific settings which will change automatically to meet their needs.
Font > automatic

3.	Name the table.   This is required as a screen reader can identify where the table is, such as where the column headers are and where the table ends.  To name a table, select all the cells in the table, then go to insert option and then select table. 
Insert > Table

![Image of where to find the insert table option in Excel](assets/Insert-table.png)
 
Once the table is created, Excel will automatically re-format the colours and add filters to the top.  Remove the colours and filters from the table.  You can do this by going to using the table style options, as outlined below.
Design > Table Style options > untick everything except ‘Header Row’.

If you need to adjust the table afterwards go to Design > Resize tables

If you press F5 you can see the tables that have been named.

## Reformat existing statistical release tables

This option involves re-formatting the existing statistical release spreadsheet.  This option is more manual and will probably take longer to do than option one. However, the formatting will be similar to the current output.   The GSS have confirmed if option one is carried out, then there is no need to also do option two.

An example can be seen within the [HMPPS workforce spreadsheet](https://justiceuk-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/christopher_casanovas_justice_gov_uk/ESTlUuMQMcFEoqb9d6QnPH0Bo7v5qNpHgqZvN-6DhWeE6Q).

This section has been split into essential changes, and those which are nice to have.

### Essential changes:

1.	Ensure cell A1 is the table heading for the sheet.  This is because screen readers start from cell A1.  To do this choose the ‘heading 1’ option from the style section.
Home > Cell style > Heading 

![Image of where to find the heading selection in Excel](assets/Heading.png)
 
The heading will automatically format to a standard Excel format.  Following this, remove the border, re-format the font and convert the colour of the text to the automatic colour.  GSS recommends using the automatic colour, as opposed to black, as some users have specific settings which will change automatically to meet their needs.
Font > automatic

2.	Remove superscript within table heading.  Screen readers cannot read out superscript, and they can be difficult to see.  The GSS recommends adding square brackets to the end of the title and putting the note number(s) within the square brackets.  Please see below for an example:

Table 1: HMPPS staff in post (full time equivalent), by HQ and Area Services, Youth Custody Service, Prison Service structure and Probation Service region, England and Wales, 2016 to 2021 [note 1,2,3]

3.	Remove merged cells.  Merged cells must be removed since screen readers cannot understand merged cells.  Adjust the row height if required to fit in the text.

4.	Name the table.   This is required as a screen reader can identify where the table is, such as where the column headers are and where the table ends.  To name a table, select all the cells in the table, then go to insert option and then select table. 
Insert > Table

![Image of where to find the insert table option in Excel](assets/Insert-table.png)
 
Once the table is created, Excel will automatically re-format the colours and add filters to the top.  Remove the colours and filters from the table.  You can do this by going to using the table style options, as outlined below.
Design > Table Style options > untick everything except ‘Header Row’.
If you need to adjust the table afterwards go to Design > Resize tables

5.	The colour contrast between the font and background used must be at least WCAG AA compliant.  [This contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) can be used to check if the colours used are compliant.  Insert your foreground and background colours into the website, and it will tell you if the contrast fails or passes.

6.	Ensure correct use of colour.  Colours used should not be the only way a trend is shown.  For example, using red to show negative numbers (without any minus sign).  If colours are used to highlight a trend, the user should also be able to identify the trend without the use of colour.  For example, for negative numbers have a minus sign as well as the red colour.  

### Nice to have changes, but not essential:

The following steps are not required to be compliant with accessibility regulations but are recommended as best practice. 

7.	Review how borders are used.  Using borders does not fail accessibility regulations.  However, if they are overused they can make visualising the table difficult.  An alternative is to increase the row height to create white space between rows and columns.

8.	Ensure correct alignment of cells.  Row labels are left aligned and data are right aligned.

9.	Review how notes are shown.  The GSS recommends adding notes and footnotes onto a single worksheet, rather than at the bottom of a table.  The rationale for this are notes are more likely to be read, rather than at the end of a long table.  The GSS also suggest adding an extra notes row or column within the table to highlight where notes are relevant, rather than a symbol or footnote.

10.	Cell A2 description.   The GSS recommends adding a description of what is contained within the sheet below the title.   
E.g.  This worksheet contains two tables.  One on HMPPS staff joiners and one on HMPPS staff leavers.
